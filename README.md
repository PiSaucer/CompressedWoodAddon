# Compressed Wood Addon
![](background.jpg)

With this addon, anyone will be able to compress any wood into the 16 new blocks that allow for an easier form to carry.

This was inspired by the original mod in Minecraft: Java Edition called [Compressed Blocks Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compressed-blocks-mod). This was suggested by Pokededg on MCPEDL
